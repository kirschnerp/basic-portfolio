        My name is Paul Kirschner. I was the middle of 5 children, 4 boys and 1 girl.  I grew up in Torrington, CT. 
       I am married with 2 children.  I love music and technology, ironically technology which ruined the music 
       industry. I was introduced to IT when I was in the Air Force.  I was attempting to get things done the old 
       fashioned way, phone calls and visits in person.  I walked into an office complaining about my lack of progress
       the gentleman at the desk typed on his computer and located all the parts I was looking for within several minutes.
       You are always told to never volunteer for anything in the service, but I volunteered to work in that office against
       the advice of just about everyone I know.  About 3 weeks into my new job the NCO in charge came in and told me 
       congratulations you are now the assistant LAN administrator.
